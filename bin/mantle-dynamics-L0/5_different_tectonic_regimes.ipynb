If the convective stresses are not enough to overcome the lithospheric yield stress, the planet's surface will not break to form plate boundaries and it may have no surface motion. These bodies exihibit *Stagnant lid convection* (e.g., present-day Mars and Venus). On the other hand, some planetary bodies may also have \"heat pipe\" regime, where the magma erupts to the surface in narrow vertical channels through the lithosphere, e.g., Io.\n","\n","The following figure illustrates some of the different tectonic regimes :\n","\n","<figure>\n","<img src=\"images/mantle_convection_cell.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n","<figcaption align = \"center\"> Image source: Anna GÃ¼lcher (2023) through  CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. </figcaption>  \n","</figure>"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.5"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
