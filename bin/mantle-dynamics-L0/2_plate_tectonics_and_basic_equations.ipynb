    "* **Ridge push** : The gravitational sliding of the lithosphere over an asthenosphere at the elevated mid-oceanic ridge\n",
    "* **Transform fault friction** : The resistance between the plates at the transform boundary as they slide relative to each other\n",
    "* **Mantle drag** : The force acting at the base of the plates\n",
    "* **Suction** : The negative pressure suction created as the subducting plate displaces the existing mantle material. This suction pulls the overriding plate towards the trench.  \n",

Mantle drag can be either resistive or driving depending on the direction of mantle flow relative to the overlying plate motion. </figcaption>  \n",
