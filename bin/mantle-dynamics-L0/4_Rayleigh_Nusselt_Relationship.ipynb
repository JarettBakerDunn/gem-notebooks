    "The expected degree of convection is described by a dimensionless number, Rayleigh Number (Ra):\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    Ra = \\frac{\\Delta\\rho D^3}{{\\eta}k} = \\frac{\\rho_0 g {\\alpha}{\\Delta}T D^3}{{\\eta}k}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\Delta \\rho$ is the density difference of the convecting material, approximated using the reference density, $\\rho_0$, the thermal expansivity of the material, $\\alpha$, and temprature difference of the material with the surroundings, ${\\Delta}T$. The length scale, thermal conductivity, and the viscosity of the convecting fluid is $D$, $k$, and $\\eta$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Rayleigh number physically represents the ratio of the convective to the conductive vigor. In practice, the value of Ra can be understood by the following example scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A cubic millimeter of honey will not convect for a temperature difference of 100K BUT a cubic kilometer of honey may.\n",
    "*  A cubic kilometer of honey will not convect for a temperature difference of 0.1K BUT it may with a temperature difference of 100K\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, as the Rayleigh number increase, convection becomes more vigorous, and more heat is transported convectively.\n",

    "### Nusselt Number\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Nusselt Number\" represents the ratio of the total heat transfer to the conductive heat tranfer through a boundary. The Rayleigh number has a known empirical relationship with the Nusselt number: $Nu \\approx Ra^\\frac{1}{3} $"
