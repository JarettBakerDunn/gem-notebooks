    "## The .prm file\n",
    "\n",
    "For this module, you will need the parameter file 'mantle-flow.prm' which is available in the current directory. All the input parameters in this file can be loaded as a dictionary using the python script, `aspect_prmf.py` available [here](https://github.com/mgouiza/aspect-prmf).\n",
    "\n",
    "This file  provides the numerical parameters to run the simulation: convection in a 2D box over time as it is heated from below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will walk you through the key parameters used to formulate this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASPECT uses SI units: meter, kg, seconds/years.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> The parameter names and their values are case-sensitive. This means that using `Function` instead of `function` will throw an error in ASPECT.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Global Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameter values are loaded in the `main` function in ASPECT to describe the simulation parameters that determine the overall behavior of the simulation such as the time duration and the output directory to store the solution files.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Geometry Model\n",
    "ASPECT has many built-in geometry models, e.g., \"box\" and \"spherical shell\" models. Box models can be rectangular (2D) or cuboid (3D). The snippet below demonstrates how to set the geometry model in the input file:\n",

    "```\n",
    "subsection Geometry model\n",
    "    set Model name = box\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Temperature\n",
    "Initial condition models specify the initial temperature. Modeling the initial temperature as a function lets us specify the initial temperature as a formula, with user defined constants. In this example, we are specifying a sinusoidal perturbation to a linear temperature profile. This can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ T(x,y) = T_{top} + (T_{bottom} - T_{top}) (1 - \\frac{y}{d} -pcos(\\frac{k{\\pi}x}{L})sin(\\frac{{\\pi}y}{d}))$,\n",
    "\n",

    "        set Function expression = T_top + (T_bottom-T_top)*(1-(y/D)-p*cos(k*pi*x/L)*sin(pi*y/D)))\n",
    "    end\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature at the Boundary\n",
    "In this model, the temperature is fixed at 3600K at the bottom of the box and 273K at the top of the box. Depending on the model, left and right temperature options can be similarly specified. In 3D models, you can also specify the `back` and `front` temperatures. When boundaries are unspecified, the default is no heat flux (i.e., an insulated boundary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify the top and bottom temperature using the following section:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "subsection Boundary temperature model\n",

    "### Velocity at the Boundary\n",
    "Velocity at the boundaries can be specified by:\n",
    "- Prescribing the velocity at the boundaries manually\n",
    "- Choosing prescribed tractions\n",
    "- Choosing \"free slip\" boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The section below specifies free slip boundaries on all sides:\n",

    "    set Tangential velocity boundary indicators = left, right, top, bottom\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretization\n",
    "The initial global refinement specifies the mesh “grid spacing”. An additional level of refinement increases the number of cells by a factor of 4 in 2D. The model can also be refined at specific regions using \"Initial adaptive refinement\" criteria. In this file, we only use global refinement as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "subsection Mesh refinement\n",
    "    set Initial global refinement = 3\n",
    "    set Initial adaptive refinement = 0\n",

    "\n",
    "### Material Model\n",
    "This section describes the material properties of the model, such as density, viscosity, thermal conductivity etc. ASPECT provides various built in material models from which the user can choose. In this file, `simpler` model is used and, as specified here, has constant value for all material properties, except density which depends on temperature as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho (p, T) = \\rho_0 (1 - \\alpha (T - T_0))$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $\\rho_0, \\alpha, T$, represent the reference density, thermal expansivity, and temperature, respectively. The variations in density of the material lead to the resultant buoyancy forces needed to drive the convective flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details are available in the ASPECT manual on the formulation of the material model.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Postprocessing\n",
    "The postprocessing section of the input file tells ASPECT how to analyze the simulation data. The section below specifies heat flow and other statistics that are output with the solution. In this case, graphical output is generated every $10^7$ years.\n",
