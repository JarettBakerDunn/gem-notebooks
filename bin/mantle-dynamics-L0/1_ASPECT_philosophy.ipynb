Consequently, it includes capabilities for viscous, visco-plastic, and elastoviscoplastic rheologies, melting, free surfaces, and more. More information about ASPECT and it's philosophy can be found in [this](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/blob/main/cookbooks/convection-box/tutorial-onset-of-convection/notebooks/tutorial_intro.ipynb) notebook.\n","\n","### Using ASPECT\n","ASPECT is a command line tool. ASPECT is driven by text-based input files which use the .prm extension. It outputs statistics files which can be visualized as well as file formats recognized by common visualizaition packages such as paraview. Using the command line tool, writing input files, and interpreting output files will be demonstrated later in this tutorial.\n","\n","### Installation\n","There are two ways to install/use ASPECT with this module:\n","\n","1. [HUBZero environment with ASPECT](https://geodynamics.org/resources/tools): ASPECT and its dependencies are installed system-wide, and no other software needs to be installed. (**preferred option**)\n","\n","2. Local installation in the machine where this module is run :\n","There are a number of ways to install ASPECT. Please refer to the ASPECT [manual](https://aspect-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install/index.html) for help installing ASPECT."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5e182de7","metadata":{"id":"5e182de7"},"source":["## ASPECT Parameter File\n","ASPECT models are described through parameter files that determine: (i) discretization details, (ii) initial conditions, (iii) boundary conditions, and more.
