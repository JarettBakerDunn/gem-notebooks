    "\n",
    "The expected degree of convection is described by a dimensionless number, Rayleigh Number (Ra):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    Ra = \\frac{\\rho_0 g {\\alpha}{\\Delta}T D^3}{{\\eta}k}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\Delta \\rho$ is the density difference of the convecting material, approximated using the reference density, $\\rho_0$, the thermal expansivity of the material, $\\alpha$, and temprature difference of the material with the surroundings, ${\\Delta}T$. The length scale, thermal conductivity, and the viscosity of the convecting fluid is $D$ , $k$, and $\\eta$, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Rayleigh number physically represents the ratio of the convective to the conductive vigor. In practice, the value of Ra can be understood by the following example scnerious:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that:\n",
    "- A cubic millimeter of honey will not convect for a temperature difference of 100K\n",
    "- But a cubic kilometer of honey may\n",
    "Also:\n",
    "- A cubic kilometer of honey will not convect for a temperature difference of 0.1K\n",
    "- But it may with a temperature difference of 100K\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Larger Rayleigh number -> More Vigorous convection -> More heat is transported convectively\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nusselt Number\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Nusselt Number\" represents the ratio of the total heat transfer to the conductive heat tranfer through a boundary.The Rayleigh number has a known empirical relationship with the Nusselt number, which is: $Nu \\approx Ra^\\frac{1}{3} $"
