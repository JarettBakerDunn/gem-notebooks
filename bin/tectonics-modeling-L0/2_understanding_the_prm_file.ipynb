    "## The .prm file\n",
    "\n",
    "For this module, you would need the parameter file, 'mantle-flow.prm', available in the current directory. This file simulates the convection in a 2D box over time as it is heated from bottom. Below, we will walk you through the key parameters used to formulate this model.\n",

    "ASPECT uses SI units: meter, kg, seconds/years.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometry Model\n",
    "ASPECT has many built-in geometry models, e.g., \"box\" and \"spherical shell\" models. Box models can be rectangular (2D) or cuboid (3D). The code below demonstrates how to set the geometry model in the input file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "subsection Geometry model\n",
    "    set Model name = box\n",
    "    subsection Box\n",
    "        set X extent = 4.2e6\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Temperature\n",
    "Initial condition models specify the initial temperature. Modeling the initial temperature as a function lets us specify the initial temperature as a formula, with user defined constants. In this example, we are specifying a sinusoidal perturbation to a linear temperature profile. Here is the equation for temperature:\n",
    "$ T(x,y) = T_{top} + (T_{bottom} - T_{top}) (1 - \\frac{y}{d} -pcos(\\frac{k{\\pi}x}{L})sin(\\frac{{\\pi}y}{d}))$, and the code to implement that temperature equation:\n",

    "### Temperature at the Boundary\n",
    "In this model, the temperature is fixed at 3600K at the bottom of the box and 273K at the top of the box. Depending on the model, left and right temperature options can be similarly specified (so can the back and front temperatures in 3D models). When boundaries are unspecified, they default to no heat flux (i.e., an insulated boundary). Here is the code to specify top and bottom temperature:\n",

    "### Velocity at the Boundary\n",
    "There are a few options for velocity at the boundaries:\n",
    "- Prescribing the velocity at the boundaries manually,\n",
    "- Choosing prescribed tractions,\n",
    "- Choosing \"free slip\" boundaries\n",

    "### Discretization\n",
    "The initial global refinement specifies the mesh “grid spacing”. An additional level of refinement increases the number of cells by a factor of 4 in 2D. The model can also be refined at specific regions using \"Adaptive refinement\" criteria. In this file, we only use global refinement and the follwoing code describes this:\n",

    "### Material Model\n",
    "This section describes the material properties of the model, such as density, viscosity, thermal conductivity etc. ASPECT provides various built in material models the user can choose from. In this file, `Simpler` model is used that has constant value for all material properperties, except density which depends on temperature. More details are available in the ASPECT manual on the formulation of the material model.\n",

    "### Postprocessing\n",
    "The postprocessing section of the input file tells ASPECT how to analyze the simulation data. The code below specifies heat flow and other statistics that are output with the solution. In this case, graphical output is generated every $10^7$ years. \n",
