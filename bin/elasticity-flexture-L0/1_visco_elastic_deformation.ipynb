    "## Viscoelastic deformation\n",
    "\n",
    "A material is considered *elastic* if it goes back to its original shape once the applied force is removed (see figure below). Under elastic deformation, the strains are linearly proportional to the applied stresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "At shallow depths, where both temperatures and pressures are low, rocks dominantly deform elastically. However, if stresses are high, rocks may be deform in a brittle manner at low temperatures and pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "At greater depth and under high temperature and pressure conditions, the rocks can *flow* and are better described by their viscous behavior. For [Newtonian fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_fluid), the strain rate of rocks is proportional to the applied stress.\n",
    "Several geological evidence exist that point to the viscous deformation of the Earth's mantle. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Post glacial rebound**: uplift of the Earth's crust in response to the mantle flow underneath as the glacial load is removed.\n",
    "2. **Plate tectonics**: surface experessions such as mountains and basins form as plates move relative to each other over a convecting mantle.\n",
    "3. **Seismic anisotropy**: seismic anisotropy observed in tectonically active regions suggests mantle shearing.\n",
    "4. **Hotspot track**: Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain formed as the Pacific plate moved over the Hawaiian mantle plume."
