    "\n",
    "**Volumetric heat production (A)** in the crust and mantle is due to the radioactive decay of $^{235}U$, $^{238}U$, $^{232}Th$, and $^{40}K$ and constitute a substantial part of the heat lost through the Earth’s surface.\n",

    "The total heat production ($A_{0}$) is related to the heat generation rates of the individual radioactive elements:\n",
