Ideally, from a certain resolution onward the solution should no longer change significantly. It is desirable to use a grid spacing for which, for example, the thermal boundary layers or crustal compositions are well-resolved and the resolution therefore does not affect the model evolution anymore.\n","- **Free surface:** Numerical instabilities can arise when using free surface with a too large time step due to the large density contrast at the surface interface (air: 1.2 $kg.m^{-3}$ vs crust: 2800 $kg.m^{-3}$). It leads to much larger stress perturbations from topographic changes compared to similar topography variations at a typical density contrast inside the Earth. This is solved by using either smaller time steps or a stabilisation algorithm to enable the model to run stably with larger time steps. Diffusion of the surface topography can also help to stabilise the model by smoothing high-gradient topography. However, this mimics erosional processes and could change the physics included in the model.\n","- **Internal inconsistencies:** Verify that combination of initial and boundary conditions are consistent. For example, when the net prescribed inflow and outflow through the model boundaries is not (close to) zero, while a model is assumed incompressible, volume is no longer conserved and the solver for the Stokes equations might crash or return a nonsensical solution. Another example is prescribed surface velocities based on, for example, plate reconstructions models, which can add unrealistic amounts of energy into the modeled system.\n","\n","Not all errors are easily detectable or manifest themselves as numerical problems. Visual inspection of the modeling results can help in identifying issues with model setup and imposed initial and boundary conditions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wkxazCmqJITZ"},"source":["**Model vs. Nature**\n","\n","Model results must be consistent with our understanding of geodynamic processes and existing geological and/or geophysical observations. At the same time, deviations of the model results from generic observations and understandings is not necessarily indicative of numerical errors. This makes validating numerical models difficult.\n","\n","Uncertainty quantification and cross-validation of numerical models, beyond the typical testing and predicting of hypotheses, become increasingly important to assess how well they capture the Earth processes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"exTH1pA1JITZ"},"source":["<div style=\"text-align: right\">  &rarr; <b>NEXT:</b> <a href=\"9_analysis_geodynamic_modeling_L0.ipynb\">Model Analysis</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","<img src=\"../assets/education-gem-notebooks_icon.png\" alt=\"icon\"  style=\"width:4%\">\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GLKRruH8JITa"},"source":["---\n","### Extra\n","Convection in a box method comparison study:\n","\n","> vanKeken, P.
