Mathematically, we distinguish between five main types of boundary conditions:\n","1. **Dirichlet** boundary conditions (also called first-type or fixed) specify the value of the solution of an equation.\n","2. **Neumann** boundary conditions (also called second-type) specify the value of the derivative of the solution.\n","3. **Robin** boundary conditions (also called third-type) are linear combinations of the values and the derivatives of the solution.\n","4. **Mixed** boundary conditions indicate that across one boundary, Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions are applied to specific parts of that boundary. For example, in lithosphere dynamics, there could be both a lithospheric plate and the mantle at the vertical boundary of a Cartesian model. Mixed boundary conditions applied here could be a constant velocity (Dirichlet) applied to the lithospheric plate, while the mantle has an open boundary condition (Neumann).\n","5. **Cauchy** boundary condition according to which both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition are applied to a boundary simultaneously by specifying both the solution and its normal derivative. Note that this differs from Robin boundary conditions as there is no linear combination and the normal derivative is specifically prescribed for Cauchy boundary conditions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hAEwjjPoHohk"},"source":["For the thermo-mechanical models, we need to prescribe boundary conditions for the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy equations in order to solve them.\n","\n","For the Stokes equations, typical mechanical boundary conditions include:\n","* <u>*Free surface* (Neumann)</u>, where there is no shear (parallel to the boundary) or normal (perpendicular to the boundary) stress acting on the boundary and which can therefore freely deform according to the velocity solution. It is most commonly used in models wherein topography is important. Specifying the stress is a Neumann boundary condition because the relations between stress and velocity defined in the constitutive equations imply that fixing the stress prescribes the velocity derivatives.\n","* <u>*Free-slip boundary condition*</u>, the component of the velocity normal to the boundary is set to 0 (Dirichlet), and there are no stresses acting parallel to the boundary (Neumann). This results in material flowing freely along the boundary such as the core–mantle boundary for global convection models. Note that the free-slip boundary condition is neither a Robin nor a Cauchy boundary condition even though it combines prescribing the solution and its derivative.\n","* <u>*Prescribed velocities*</u> (Dirichlet), also called kinematic or inflow–outflow boundary conditions, are often applied at the sides of plates in lithospheric models or at the top of mantle convection models to mimic plate tectonics.\n","* <u>*No-slip boundary condition*</u> (Dirichlet) is a special case of prescribed velocities in which the velocity is zero at the boundary. This is typically used to mimic the 660 discontinuity at the bottom boundary of asthenospheric-scale models.\n","* <u>*Prescribed stresses*</u> are Neumann boundary conditions as the stresses relate to the velocities through the derivatives. They can be used to mimic plate push and topographic loads.\n","* <u>*An open boundary*</u> (Neumann) is a special case of prescribed stresses in which material can freely leave the domain."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JTEB0ChlHohl"},"source":["**Initial conditions** are required for time-dependent equations.
