    "Just like any other scientific study, numerical models should be reproducible and most importantly replicable.\n",
    "- Reproducible means that the same model on the same machine with the same code should produces the same results at the stated precision.\n",
    "- Replicable means researchers can obtain similar enough results from independent development - i.e., obtain the same conclusions using different research methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility and replicability imply that the software used to conduct the study as well as the specific model setups, installation environment specifications, and post-processing workflow should be available to the rest of the scientific community. Increasingly, scientific journals are requesting or even requiring the publication of data and software along with the manuscript. Although the requirements vary per journal, it is good practice to adhere to these principles for every publication."
