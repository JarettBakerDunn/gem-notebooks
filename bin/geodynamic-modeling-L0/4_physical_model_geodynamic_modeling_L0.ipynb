Changes in thermal energy over time is balanced by how heat is transported through a combination of advection, conduction, other sources of heat, $S$, and internal heat production, e.g., volumetric radiogenic heat production, $H$. Here, $C_p$ is isobaric heat capacity, $p$ is pressure, $T$ is temperature, and $k$ is thermal conductivity.\n",
